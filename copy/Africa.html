  <p>Advertising expenditure in Africa stood at US$ 6.3bn in 2016, according to data from WARC. This represents a year-on-year decline of 11.5% from 2015, when total spend amounted to US$ 7.1bn. Data show that the region has recorded a decline in adspend every year since 2012. However, care should be taken when comparing year-on-year totals in dollar terms, as the results will be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate. The equivalent year-on-year comparison shown in PPPs (purchasing power parities)* actually indicates growth in total regional adspend for both 2014 and 2015 and a smaller decline of 6.2% between 2015 and 2016.</p>

  <p>When considering advertising expenditure in Africa by media channel, data show that TV accounts for the majority share of adspend. In 2016 the channel accounted for US$ 2,878m, equivalent to a 46.0% share. The next biggest channel in 2016 was radio (US$ 1,381m), followed by newspapers on US$ 993m - equivalent to shares of 22.1% and 15.9% respectively. Out of home (US$ 461m, 7.4% share) came next, followed by desktop internet (US$ 263m, 4.2% share), magazines (US$ 178m, 2.8% share), mobile internet (US$61m, 1.0% share) and lastly cinema (US$ 47m, 0.7% share).</p>

  <p>Back in 2007, newspapers was the second channel of choice for advertisers behind TV, when it took a 29.6% share of the total. However, the channel has seen a dramatic decline in the last 10 years and now accounts for just 15.9% of total adspend, having dipped by a massive 13.7 percentage points (pp). TV and radio have been the main beneficiaries of this fall (up 10.0pp and 6.9pp respectively), with internet adspend remaining relatively low to date - in sharp contrast to other global regions.</p>

  <i>* PPP = Purchasing Power Parity (PPPs) measures the buying power of local currency units when spent in their domestic markets. They enable accurate international comparisons of economies and prices by removing the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. The US economy is used as the global reference point for PPPs and is set to an index value of 100.</i>
