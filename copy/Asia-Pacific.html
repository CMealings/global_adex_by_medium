Since 2007, Asia Pacific has registered year-on-year growth in advertising spend every year with the exception of 2015. However, this dip in 2015 can be attributed to a particularly strong dollar rather than an actual decline in adspend. The equivalent year-on-year comparison shown in PPPs (purchasing power parities)* indicates total regional adspend growth of 4.7% between 2014 and 2015.</p>
