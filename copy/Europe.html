  <p>Advertising expenditure in Europe was valued at US$ 128.2bn in 2016, according to data from WARC. This represents year-on-year growth of just 1.2% from 2015, when total spend amounted to US$ 128.2bn. Since 2007, Europe has registered year-on-year falls in advertising spend for 2009 (down 20.9%), 2012 (down 6.9%) and 2015 (down 11.7%). However, care should be taken when comparing totals in dollars due to the fluctuating exchange rate. For instance, the drop in 2015 can be attributed to a particularly strong dollar rather than an actual decline in adspend. The equivalent year-on-year comparison shown in PPPs (purchasing power parities)* indicates total regional adspend growth of 3.6% between 2014 and 2015.</p>

  <p>When considering advertising expenditure by media channel in Europe, data show that TV has consistently accounted for the majority share of total adspend. In 2016, TV amounted to US$ 41.0bn, equivalent to a 32.0% share. The next biggest channel in 2016 was desktop internet (US$ 34.5bn), followed by newspapers on US$ 17.8bn â€“ equivalent to shares of 26.9% and 13.8% respectively. Mobile internet (US$ 11.5bn, 9.0% share) came next, followed by magazines (US$ 8.2bn, 6.4% share), out of home (US$ 8.0bn, 6.2% share), radio (US$ 6.3bn, 4.9% share) and lastly cinema (US$ 0.9bn, 0.7% share).</p>

  <p>Back in 2007, newspapers were the second biggest channel for advertisers, when it took US$ 45.1bn, equivalent to a 29.0% share of total adspend. However, the channel has seen a dramatic decline in recent years, and share of adspend now stands at well under half its 2007 total. Newspapers accounted for just 13.8% of total adspend in 2016. Desktop and mobile internet have been the main beneficiaries of this fall, up 15.8pp and 9.0pp respectively.</p>
